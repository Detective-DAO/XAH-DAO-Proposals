# Scout Role Evaluation Criteria (v2.1)

This document outlines the structural evaluation criteria for DAO scouts, focusing on detection integrity, self-verification, and cooperative governance flow.

---

## Purpose

To establish a shared standard for evaluating contributions made by DAO scouts within the structural governance process.  
These criteria reflect the need for responsibility, structural awareness, and collaborative alignment with verifiers and architects.

---

## Evaluation Dimensions

### 1. Self-Check Criteria

Scouts must submit a self-verification section in their proposal that includes:

- ✅ **Repetition Analysis**: Is the proposed Hook related to repetitive on-chain behavior?
- ✅ **Malicious Intention**: Is there any potential sign of abuse or system manipulation?
- ✅ **Structural Impact**: Does the Hook influence existing structural logic or DAO protocols?

---

### 2. Purpose Clarity vs. Actual Structural Impact

Scouts must clearly define their **intent** in the proposal:

- What is the Hook for?
- Is it meant for order preservation, structural contribution, threat response, or feedback-based improvement?

Verifiers will assess how well this intent aligns with the actual structure and DAO integrity.

---

### 3. Degree of Collaborative Engagement

Scouts are evaluated based on:

- Quality of communication with Verifiers and Architects
- Willingness to respond to feedback
- Evidence of structural discussion or adjustment

---

### 4. RLUSD Reward Range (Optional)

Bonus RLUSD allocation may be granted based on:

- Difficulty of the proposal
- Structural influence and reach
- Integration rate of the Hook
- Quality of initial self-check report

Suggested: **3–10 RLUSD** bonus range  
(Subject to DAO funding and impact rating)

---

## Alignment Notes

This evaluation framework is part of a broader DAO structural design initiative.  
It supports:

- Consistent scouting practices
- Balanced governance dynamics
- Role-based trust systems
