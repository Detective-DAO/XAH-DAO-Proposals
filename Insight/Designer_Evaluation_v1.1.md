ðŸ“˜ Designer Evaluation Criteria and Reward Structure v1.1

A framework of accountability and incentives for structural contributors to DAO order.

â¸»

1. Purpose

This framework evaluates whether a Hook designerâ€™s contribution goes beyond implementation to reinforce
detective and verifier logic and deliver sustainable structure to the DAO system.
Designers are the final gatekeepers and structural integrators of the ecosystem.

â¸»

2. Evaluation Criteria

âœ… Feasibility Assessment
â€¢ At least 2 out of the following 3 conditions must be met:
  1. Gas usage within 50,000 units per transaction
  2. Simulation/testnet evidence of successful Hook execution
  3. No conflict with existing Hooks or DAO logic

âœ… Merge or Supplement Proposals
â€¢ If the design overlaps with existing proposals:
  - Provide name/function comparison of similar Hooks
  - Estimate improved efficiency or system resource savings

â¸»

3. Trust Evaluation Standards

ðŸ”¹ Structural Feasibility
â€¢ Must specify the functional role within DAO logic

ðŸ”¹ Post-deployment Stability
ðŸ”¹ Documentation & Feedback Responsiveness
ðŸ”¹ Modularity & Maintenance Efficiency
ðŸ”¹ Redundancy Avoidance
â€¢ Provide checklist and prior analysis if similar Hooks exist

ðŸ”¹ Structural Insight & Usability

4. Trust Downgrade Conditions

Condition | Description | Procedure
--- | --- | ---
Repeated Designs | Same-purpose Hook proposed more than twice | Warning â†’ DAO Record â†’ Downgrade at 3rd instance
Unclear Intent | Poor explanation of design purpose | Feedback request â†’ 7-day response window â†’ Downgrade by verifier if unfulfilled
Failure Post-Execution | Causes systemic conflict/failure | Downgrade depending on predictability
Ignored Feedback | Ignores verifierâ€™s request | Immediate downgrade + 1 design restriction
Lack of Collaboration | Solo action without consultation | Warning â†’ Repeated offense = 7-day ban

5. Monitoring Duty

âœ… Post-deployment Reports Required (1â€“2 times)
â€¢ 1 missed report: reward withheld
â€¢ 2+ missed: restriction on future proposals

âœ… Must include:
â€¢ Target outcome confirmation
â€¢ DAO response or data
â€¢ Optional enhancements or redesign suggestions

6. Reward & Bonus Scheme

Contribution | Reward | Basis
--- | --- | ---
Design Finalized | 30 RLUSD | Basic structure
Includes Monitoring | 40 RLUSD | Trust-building
Merged or Stabilized Design | 50+ RLUSD | System-level design
Verifier Feedback Applied | +10â€“20 RLUSD | â‰¥80% applied rate
Long-term Contribution | Additional reward | 90+ day impact

7. Philosophy Summary

Designers are structural integrators, order maintainers, collaborators, and ecosystem architects
who detect future directions of the DAO and sustain its living system.
