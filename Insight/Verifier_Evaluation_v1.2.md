# Verifier Role Evaluation Criteria (v1.2)

A structural framework for DAO Verifiers to uphold order, provide rationale, and guide both Scouts and Architects through responsible decision-making.

---

## 🧭 Introduction

DAO operates on order — and that order begins with a collective mindset anchored in responsibility.  
Verifiers are not mere "yes/no" judges. They serve as **structural aligners** between Scouts and Architects and act as the DAO’s **standards of judgment**.

A Verifier must articulate *why a proposal is approved or rejected*, mentor the Scout with direction, and signal the Architect for potential structural implications.  
This is not merely a checklist, but a philosophical framework that articulates the mindset and responsibility expected of Verifiers in a self-governing DAO.

---

## ✅ 1. Role of the Verifier

- Review proposals in the following order:
  - Review the Scout’s self-assessment and stated objectives
  - Provide feedback if the intent, design, or philosophy is unclear
  - Evaluate for structural contribution, redundancy, and Hook complementarity
  - Ensure decisions align with DAO’s core definitions
  - Ensure rationale for all decisions is clearly documented
  - Relay decisions as *signals* to the Architect

---

## ✅ 2. Criteria for Persuasive Verifiers

Verifiers are not just decision-makers — they are directional advisors to the structural DAO.

- Must clearly explain reasons for approval or rejection
- Offer actionable feedback to Scouts for structural enhancement
- Notify Architects with potential design paths — not just judgment
- If the decision includes risk forecasting or potential impact, it is considered a high-difficulty evaluation

---

## ✅ 3. Consensus-Based Governance & Responsibility

- All decisions are made by a group of at least 3 Verifiers
- This consensus is *not* for immunity — but for **shared responsibility**
- In case of Hook failure or DAO misuse:
  - If judgment lacked proper rationale or violated DAO principles,
  - DAO Ops or Architects may adjust trust scores or request remediation

---

## ✅ 4. Difficulty Levels & Assignment Logic

- Verifiers are assigned proposals based on trust level and scope
- Proposal types determine difficulty tags:
  - 🔹 General Structural Improvement
  - 🔸 Threat Detection
  - 🔺 Full Structural Design Induction
- Tags can be auto-assigned or manually updated by DAO stewards

---

## ✅ 5. Verifier = Leadership-Oriented Mentor

- Regardless of outcome, offer structural direction to Scouts
- Help identify deficiencies to increase re-submission success
- For repeated triggers: provide **boundary standards**, not just warnings
- All structural notes must be shared with Architects for iterative feedback
- Verifiers also contribute to institutional memory by shaping DAO-wide decision patterns

## ✅ 6. Reward & Trust Evaluation Logic

| Situation                                         | Result                               |
|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| ✅ Structural contribution with design linkage    | Trust ↑ & reward eligible            |
| ⚠️ Approval of careless/repetitive triggers       | Trust ↓ & mandatory feedback         |
| ✅ Risk filtering or design redirection provided  | Bonus reward possible                |
| ✅ Clear signaling toward architectural flow      | Tag upgrade in difficulty scoring    |
