# ðŸ§­ [Recon Proposal #004]  
## Charter of Reward Structure: A Declaration on Mission, Responsibility, and Order

---

### 1. Introduction

This is not merely a proposal for a reward system.  
It is a **declaration of mission** â€” why a DAO rewards, and why we are qualified to receive it.

> We look beyond profit and seek **balance**.  
> We act not for fame, but for **order**.  
> We leave behind not results, but **enduring principles** for sustainable structure.

---

### 2. What Should DAO Rewards Be Based On?

A DAO does not reward based solely on quantity of contributions.  
It rewards **genuine intent to uphold order**, **endurance of responsibility**, and **meaningful structural insight**.

Therefore, we declare the following principles:

- Rewards must be granted based on **thoughtful effort and execution** contributing to the structure.  
- Rewards should prioritize those who understand the structure and act with **insight and purpose**.  
- Rewards must acknowledge the **sacrifice** and **burden borne** for the survival of the system.  
- Rewards should be adjusted not by mere actions, but by **orderly, coherent movement**.

### 3. From the Reconâ€™s Perspective: What Does DAO Reward Mean?

A recon must continually ask:

- What are we protecting right now?  
- For whom is this structure of order being preserved?  
- Does my proposal serve as a mechanism for the DAO to **function longer and more resiliently**?

> Let us reaffirm:  
> Rewards are the DAOâ€™s **response to what we protect** â€” its structure, purpose, and balance.

---

### 4. A Promise for the Future

> We exist for the structure.  
> What we protect is not profit, but **balance**.  
> What we pursue is not reputation, but **order**.  
> What we leave behind is not temporary achievement, but a **sustainable foundation**.

- A DAO is not just a system.  
- It is a structure moved by **mission, responsibility, and love**.

---

### ðŸ“Œ This Charter Serves As a Standard For:

- A **minimum benchmark** for future reward-related proposals  
- A **responsibility guideline** for Recon, Verifier, and Architect roles  
- A **value declaration** linked to DAOâ€™s trust and ethical framework
