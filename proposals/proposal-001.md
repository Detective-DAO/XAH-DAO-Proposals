# [Proposal #001] Entry Filter & Responsibility Hook Design

## 🔍 Summary
Designing a Hook-based mechanism to filter and guide initial DAO participants  
toward responsibility-based participation instead of speculation.

## 🎯 Objective
- Detect repeated low-effort or exploitative triggers  
- Redirect DAO attention to consistent structural contributors  
- Record and assess behavioral intent using Hook-triggered logic

## 🧱 Structure (Draft)
1. Hook scans for repetitive trigger signatures  
2. Flag behaviors exceeding frequency + entropy threshold  
3. Report sent to Recon DAO layer for observation and optional voting  
4. Reward/penalty triggers determined by aggregated behavioral pattern
