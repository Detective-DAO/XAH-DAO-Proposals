# Proposal #001: Responsibility-Based Detection Filter Design

---

## üß≠ Objective

To design a filter that ensures Hook detection proposals submitted by Recon members are based on **responsibility**.  
It aims to prevent abuse, maintain detection quality, and preserve DAO order.

---

## üìå Summary

This proposal addresses common issues in recon activities, such as:

- Excessive or indiscriminate detections  
- Low-effort proposals driven by scoring incentives  
- Inefficient reports lacking analysis of repetition, intent, or structural risk  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Filter Components

### 1. Self-Check Form (Mandatory for Recon Agent)

- **Purpose of Detection**:  
  - Clearly state the goal of the trigger detection  
  - Threat response *(e.g. detecting repeated malicious transactions)*  
  - Structural contribution *(e.g. proposing design-enhancing triggers)*  
  - Suggesting improvements *(e.g. adjusting existing Hook conditions)*

- **Structural Damage Risk**: Yes / No *(with examples or reasoning)*  
- **Repeated Behavior Observed**: Yes / No  
- **Malicious Intent Suspected**: Yes / No  
- **Expected Area of Contribution**: Recon / Filter / Design / Review *(multiple allowed)*

---

### 2. Recon Agent Integrity Profile

- **Summary of Previous Detections**  
- **Record of Implementing Feedback from Validators**  
- **History of Collaborative Interaction** *(with Validators, Designers, etc.)*

---

## üìà Evaluation & Rewards Criteria

- **Includes Trust Level Upgrade Conditions**
- **RLUSD Reward Guidelines**:  
  - High-value contribution: 10 RLUSD  
  - Clear intent but failed: 3 RLUSD  
  - Suspected repeated abuse: 0 RLUSD *(may result in penalties)*  
- **These are examples and may be subject to DAO adjustment**
- **Collaborative contribution to validator/designer work can increase trust rating**

---

## üß© Structural Linkages

- This proposal works in tandem with **Validator Trust Criteria** and **Designer Integration Framework**.  
- Validators will use this filter structure to **evaluate proposals and provide structured feedback**.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This proposal formalizes a responsibility-based filter  
to strengthen the integrity of detection activity in DAO.  
It aims to enhance the quality of operation and foster  
**collaborative structural relationships** between Recon agents, Validators, and Designers.
